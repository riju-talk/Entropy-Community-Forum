# Entropy Community Forum

## Product Overview

**Entropy** is a next-generation academic community platform that blends collaborative Q&A forums with advanced AI-powered study tools. Designed for students, educators, and learning communities, Entropy enables users to ask questions, share knowledge, and enhance their learning experience through intelligent features such as document-aware Q&A, mind mapping, quizzes, and flashcards.

### Key Features
- **Collaborative Q&A Forum:** Post questions, answer peers, and engage in community-driven discussions.
- **AI-Powered Study Tools:** Upload documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and receive context-aware answers, mind maps, quizzes, and flashcards generated by the AI agent.
- **Gamified Learning:** Earn credits for participation, which can be used to access premium AI features and foster healthy competition via leaderboards.
- **Community Management:** Create and join learning communities, participate in mentorship programs, and track achievements.
- **Modern, Responsive UI:** Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS for a seamless experience across devices.

## Architecture & Technology

Entropy is a monorepo structured for scalability and modern cloud deployment. It consists of two main applications:

### 1. Next.js Frontend (apps/app)
- **Role:** User interface, community features, authentication, and integration with the AI backend.
- **Stack:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Prisma ORM, TypeScript.
- **Features:**
  - Dynamic Q&A feed, doubt posting, and answer voting
  - Community and mentorship modules
  - AI study tools interface (chat, mindmap, quiz, flashcards)
  - User profiles, achievements, and leaderboard
  - Auth via OAuth (GitHub, Google)

### 2. Python AI Agent Backend (apps/ai-agent)
- **Role:** Provides AI-powered features such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), mind mapping, quiz and flashcard generation.
- **Stack:** FastAPI, LangChain, ChromaDB, Groq (Llama 3), GPT4All, Docker.
- **Features:**
  - Document upload and processing
  - Contextual Q&A with uploaded materials
  - Mind map, quiz, and flashcard generation
  - Credit system for usage throttling

---

## Data Flow & Integration
- The frontend communicates with the AI agent via REST APIs.
- Uploaded documents are processed and embedded into a vector database for semantic search and RAG.
- All AI features are credit-gated to encourage engagement and fair usage.

---

## Security & Production Notes
- Sensitive operations are protected by API tokens and environment variables.
- User data and uploads are isolated per session/community.
- The backend is designed for containerized deployment (Docker, Render, Railway).

---

## For Product Developers
- Focus on user engagement, gamification, and seamless AI integration.
- Modular design allows rapid addition of new study tools and community features.
- Built for extensibility: add new AI models, community types, or gamification mechanics easily.

## For Backend Developers
- Clear separation of concerns between frontend and AI backend.
- Scalable, container-ready architecture with health checks and environment-based configuration.
- Extensible AI agent: add new endpoints, document loaders, or AI models with minimal friction.
- Uses modern Python best practices (FastAPI, async, type hints, modular services).
